# Type1-diabetic-Prediction
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict the risk of developing Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) based on a synthetic dataset. The dataset includes 12 key risk factors such as Genetic Predisposition, Family History, Environmental Triggers, and more.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside
Data Preprocessing: Scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering using domain knowledge.

Synthetic Target Generation: Risk labels (high-risk or low-risk) created using medically-informed thresholds.

Clustering: Applied K-Means Clustering to uncover natural groupings in the data.

Anomaly Detection: Used Isolation Forest to identify and remove outliers.

Prediction: Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict T1DM risk with high accuracy.

Evaluation: Achieved an overall accuracy of 99%, with high precision and recall for both classes.

Visualization: Included graphs such as clustering scatter plots and feature importance bar charts.

ðŸ“Š Key Results
Accuracy: 99%

F1-Score (High-Risk): 99%

F1-Score (Low-Risk): 91%

Identified top predictive factors: Genetic Predisposition, Family History, Environmental Triggers

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
Type 1 Diabetes is a complex disease influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and autoimmune factors. Early prediction is crucial for preventive strategies and timely intervention. This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in medical research and support decision-making.
